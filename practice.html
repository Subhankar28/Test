    <h1 id="h1">Welcome to your Dream World</h1>
    <p id="p1">Ramayan Shah has a pavement stall selling food on Free School Street
        in front of a sign that says Sarabhai Chemicals. The building behind him is
        Karnani Mansions, and the look of the sign suggests superannuation, an
        office boarded up. Ramayan Shah and two other low-level entrepreneurs—
        the always-absent owner of Chandan Hotel, which roughly occupies six by
        six feet on the pavement, and Nagendra, with his heavy iron and board—
        have appropriated the terrain here. I can remember a time when these businesses didn’t exist in this
        location, and one could walk from Park Street up Free School Street
        without any interruption. At a glance, the stalls are squalid, a small universe
        of cooking pots, potato peels, benches, and a few people absently lolling
        under the shelter of tarpaulin. They comprise an island with no apparent
        connection to the Free School Street of the seventies and early eighties,
        with its rare second-hand vinyl records and its second-hand bookshops,
        which even now sell everything from horoscopes to Leon Uris to Salman
        Rushdie to old copies of Time. In 1982, before leaving for England,
        suddenly disenchanted by Western popular music, I remember bringing
        with me from Bombay some of the priceless records in my collection
        (among them Janis Joplin’s In Concert), to either distribute gratis among
        friends who were still under the spell of that music or permit the more
        mercantile among them to sell the records to the vendors on Free School
        Street. One of my friends earned six hundred rupees from the sale (some of
        these records were rare, bought in a London Our Price shop by my father), a
        small fortune at the time. I took nothing of the proceeds, a measure of my
        new high-minded propensities. It was a way of washing my hands, with
        violent symbolism, of my Western-music past. Yet how alive Free School
        Street was, still busy with transactions between bourgeois and punter,
        coursing with some of the sensuousness of the seventies! The second-hand
        bookshops are still there, as are the vendors of the vinyl records, but it isn’t
        clear who the customers are. There’s more activity in the recent
        Bangladeshi restaurants, and in the small shady foreign exchange outlets at
        which Bangladeshi tourists can quickly change takas into rupees.

        Just here, not far from Ramayan Shah’s business, is one of the city’s
nerve-centres. Downtown is one name for it, I suppose, but that term with
its hint of sleaze doesn’t capture the melee of this intersection, where
people are forever waiting to cross at the traffic lights. You have Free
School Street on one end, Middleton Row, narrower and shorter, on the
opposite side, and, at a right angle to these two, Park Street, this long road
finally opening out on to the chaos of Park Circus, and, nearer this end, to
the once-imperial artery, Chowringhee. Park Street is neither Oxford Street
nor the Champs-Élysées, but here, in the stretch between Chowringhee and
the junction of Free School Street and Middleton Row, it has an energy
comparable to no other downtown district that I know. Although Calcutta,
with its colonial buildings, was so Bengali in its metier, just here it is like
nowhere else in the city, for the Chinese and the so-called Anglo-Indians (or
Eurasians) used to live on Free School Street, and a few still do, and down
Middleton Row are the inaccessible precincts of the Loreto College for
Girls, with its calm but admonitory gates. As a child from Bombay, walking
up Park Street and approaching this junction, I knew—without quite
knowing why—that I’d never, elsewhere, had such contradictory impulses
converge around me.
